# General

### Style Vocabulary

Each guideline describes either a good or bad practice, and all have a consistent presentation.

**Do** is one that should always be followed.

**Consider** guidelines should generally be followed. If you fully understand the meaning behind the guideline and have a good reason to deviate, then do so. Please strive to be consistent.

**Avoid** indicates something you should almost never do.

**Why?** gives reasons for following the associated guideline.

### Issues Unspecified: Be Consistent!
For any style question that isn't settled definitively by this specification, prefer to do what the other code in the same file is already doing. If that doesn't resolve the question, consider emulating the other files in the same package.
